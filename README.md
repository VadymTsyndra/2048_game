This is a JavaScript program that implements the 2048 game. The program starts by setting up the game board with four rows and four columns. When the user clicks the "start" button, the board is cleared, and two tiles with either a value of 2 or 4 are added to the board. The user can then move the tiles by pressing the arrow keys on their keyboard. If two tiles with the same value are adjacent to each other and move in the same direction, they merge into a single tile with twice the value. The game is over when there are no more empty tiles on the board or when the player reaches a tile with a value of 2048.

To create this project, I utilized the following technologies and tools:

HTML: I used HTML to create the game board structure and UI elements.
CSS: I used CSS to style the game board and UI elements.
JavaScript: I used JavaScript to implement the game logic, including tile movement, collision detection, and score tracking.
